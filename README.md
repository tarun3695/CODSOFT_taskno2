# 🧮 Python Calculator – CODSOFT Task

> A simple and functional calculator built using Python that performs basic arithmetic operations directly through the command line.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **basic calculator** developed in **Python** as part of the **CODSOFT Internship**. It allows users to perform operations like **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** by entering inputs through the terminal.

This project demonstrates the power of **user-defined functions**, **input validation**, and **conditional logic** to perform mathematical calculations in a clean and structured way.

- ➖ Subtraction of two numbers
- ✖️ Multiplication of two numbers
- ➗ Division (with divide-by-zero check)
- 🔁 Loop to allow multiple calculations in a session
- 🔒 Input validation and error handling

🧠 How It Works
A menu-driven interface allows the user to select the desired operation.

The program uses basic if-else statements to perform the corresponding mathematical operation.

Each operation is handled by a separate function to promote code reusability.

The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

🔮 Future Enhancements
Add exponentiation, square root, and modulus operations

Create a Tkinter GUI version

Allow chained operations like 5 + 3 * 2

Improve UI with color and formatting in terminal

Add unit tests for calculator functions

🎯 Learning Outcomes
Use of functions for code organization

Handling user input and type conversion

Writing clean and reusable Python code

Understanding basic arithmetic operation logic
